<h2>Spirited away</h2>

<p>Honestly, anything by Studio Ghibli is a certified highly recommended movie. The art, the natural way of telling a story while making you forget it's a story.
    But Spirited Away is a <b><i>masterpiece</i></b>. The water-color like art and the whole fantasy element to it, you have to watch this.</p>

<h2>Inside Out</h2>
<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTgxMDQwMDk0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjU5OTg2NDE@._V1_.jpg" alt="" style="width: 130px;">
<p>Arguably one of the best movies from Pixar. It so realistically prtrays the mind of an adolescent girl. As well as the depiction of why all emotions are 
   equally important in a healthy person.
</p>

<h2>turning Red</h2>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9e/Turning_Red_poster.jpg" alt=""> <!--style="width: 80%;"-->
<p>Another Pixar movie that portrays adolescent girls' normal life except it's more, you know, family-problems oriented, and definetly more relatable to mordern girls.
(not saying Inside Out is any less enjoyable). Definetly would hit home to those with strict/ over-protective parents.
